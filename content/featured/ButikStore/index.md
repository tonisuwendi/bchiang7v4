The web application is an online store that can be used for selling boutique items, inspired by [lookboutiquestore.com](https://lookboutiquestore.com/). It implements a component-based system, custom hooks, React context, [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/), an authentication system, and many more. It utilizes [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for API requests, [Swiperjs](https://swiperjs.com/) for banner sliders, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for static analysis, and several other libraries.
